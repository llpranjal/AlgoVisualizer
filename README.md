# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A simple web application built with React to visualize classic sorting algorithms.

## Live Demo

Here's a quick look at the visualizer in action.

**Before Sorting:** A randomly generated, unsorted array.

**After Sorting:** The same array, now sorted, with all bars colored to indicate completion.

## Features

*   **Visualize Algorithms**: Watch Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Bubble Sort in action.
*   **Interactive Controls**: Fine-tune your visualization experience with two simple sliders:
    *   **Array Size Slider**: Increase or decrease the number of elements in the array to see how algorithm complexity affects performance.
    *   **Animation Speed Slider**: Slow down the animation to carefully observe every step, or speed it up for a quick overview of the sorting process.
*   **Dynamic Data**: Generate a new random array at any time.
